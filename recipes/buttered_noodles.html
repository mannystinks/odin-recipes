    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Saucy, buttered noodles are simple to make and perfect to serve either as-is or alongside steak, chicken, or meatballs. Butter, Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper are all you need for this quick and easy, kid-friendly dish, although fresh herbs and a little lemon juice could be added to amp up the flavor. It's such a delicious recipe, yet I get many questions on how to make it.</p>
<h4>Ingrediants</h4>
<ul>
    <li>1 package (16oz) fettuccine noodles</li>
    <li>6 tbsp butter (cut into pieces)</li>
    <li>1/3 cup grated parmesian cheese</li>
    <li>Salt and Pepper to taste</li>
</ul>
<h4>Directions</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in fettuccine, bring back to a boil, and cook pasta over medium heat until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and return pasta to pot.</li>
    <li>Mix butter, Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper into pasta until evenly combined.</li>
</ol>
