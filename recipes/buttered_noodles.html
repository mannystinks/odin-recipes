    <h1>Buttered Noodles</h1>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Saucy, buttered noodles are simple to make and perfect to serve either as-is or alongside steak, chicken, or meatballs. Butter, Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper are all you need for this quick and easy, kid-friendly dish, although fresh herbs and a little lemon juice could be added to amp up the flavor. It's such a delicious recipe, yet I get many questions on how to make it.</p>
